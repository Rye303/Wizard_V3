NEW: strength atribute

NEEDED: bluetooth connection to Pi

Parcels the class "PlayerStats" to new activities.

V3 now includes an integer value stat "strength"
    Strength is determined via the "CharacterClass" selection for either Warrior, Wizard, or Druid
    
Newer versions should have a way to readjust (incriment/level-up) the stats.
    These level ups should come via bluetooth promps from playercards.
